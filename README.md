# Human Detection in Nano Size with YOLOv9 üëÅÔ∏èüëÅÔ∏è

## Project Overview

This project focuses on training a YOLOv9 model for human detection in nano-sized images. The dataset used for training contains annotated images and labels specifically designed for detecting humans in small-scale images. The YOLOv9 model is trained to accurately identify and localize human objects within these nano-sized images.

## Dataset Creation

1. **Dataset Preparation**: Images and annotations were collected and organized specifically for human detection in nano-sized images.

2. **Annotation with Roboflow**: The dataset was annotated using Roboflow, a platform that provides tools for annotating images with bounding boxes for object detection tasks.

3. **Exporting Dataset**: The annotated dataset was exported in YOLOv8 format, compatible with YOLOv9 training.

## Setup and Requirements

1. **Environment**: Ensure you have a compatible environment with NVIDIA GPU support.
   - You can check GPU availability using `!nvidia-smi`.

2. **Mount Google Drive**: Mount your Google Drive to access files.
   ```python
   from google.colab import drive
   drive.mount('/content/drive')
   ```
3. **Navigate to YOLOv9 Directory**:
    ```python
    %cd /content/drive/MyDrive/yolo9/yolov9
   ```
4. **Install Required Libraries**: YOLOv9 relies on PyTorch, OpenCV, and other libraries. Ensure they are installed.
